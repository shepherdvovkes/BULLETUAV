## Mission Statement

The BULLET UAV system is designed to provide reliable protection against modern threats, including **strike and reconnaissance UAVs**, **helicopters**, and other low-speed aerial targets. Through the integration of advanced navigation, homing technologies, and high-precision warheads, it ensures effective mission execution under adverse weather conditions and at any time of day.

In addition to countering aerial threats, the system is capable of engaging **ground targets** such as radar systems, air defense units like **Buk and S-300/400**, vehicles, and strategically important facilities.

## Autonomous Capabilities

### Intelligent Target Prioritization
```
Priority Matrix:
  S-300/400 Systems: 100    (Highest threat)
  Buk Air Defense: 95
  Helicopters: 80
  Shahed Drones: 60
  Ground Vehicles: 40
  Maritime Targets: 30
```

### Autonomous Operations
- **Independent Target Search** - When primary target not found
- **Classification & Engagement** - AI-powered target recognition
- **Self-Defense** - Evasive maneuvers against countermeasures
- **Return-to-Launch** - Automatic RTL on communication loss
- **Self-Destruct** - Configurable safety protocols

### Homing System
The advanced homing system constantly searches for aerial targets, maneuvers for classification and trajectory determination before attacking. If no target is detected, it searches for a priority target in autonomous or manual mode for engagement.
